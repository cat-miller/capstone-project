## MY ANIMAL CROSSING JOURNAL

### `Description`

My app is designed to help fans of the popular Nintendo game Animal Crossing.

You can look up critters and villagers, sort them by different criteria and filter them. On the dashboard page, you can
find a passport for your own data and have an overview of your game progress.

There are 4 themes with which you can define the look of the app.
